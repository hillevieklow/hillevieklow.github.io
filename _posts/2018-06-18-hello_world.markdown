In only a few months I will have finished college, and can then proudly say I completed *and survived* a bachelors degree in Mathematics. As most of my peers at this point, I have come to ask myself a very important question: what is next? Most mathematics graduates from my class will do one out of two things: a) getting a teaching certificate, or b) continue studying. Unfortunately, I cannot do either. 

Being an international student, teaching is not an option since most states require citizenship for certification. Secondly, to continue my studies in the U.S. does not make financial sense, since I will no longer be able to get the athletic scholarship I have been relying on for four years. As I am speaking to my family about my options, my brother burst out: "What about coding?". I knew then and there that he was right. In fact, I was almost embarrassed I had not thought of that myself. I quickly enrolled myself in a CS101 course, and it was the most fun class I have ever had. 

This spring I got accepted into Flatiron Schools Online Full-Stack Web Developer Coding Bootcamp. It is a robust curriculum, and I have decided to dedicate my entire summer to it (perks of being a student, summer break!). As of right now, I am 3 weeks into my coding journey, and I am truly enjoying it so, so much. I cannot wait to learn more.
