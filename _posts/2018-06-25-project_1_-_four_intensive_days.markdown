I have been on the Learn.co platform for about a month now, and a few days back it was finally time for me to build my first personal project. At first, the freedom felt very intimidating, because after all;*I am on my own now*. No prepared Flatiron School tests to pass, no access to Ask A Question, no nothing. Well, besides Google. And oh boy, did I Google! 

After watching [Avi's DailyDeal gem walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lDExWIhYKI) on youtube, the initial self-doubt I was feeling had more or less disappeared. What I had watched made all sense, Avi's project was based on concepts I was familiar with and had practiced these last few weeks. I quickly set up my computer to start coding the first version of a project, a DailyWord CLI App. However, after a day of trying to puzzle everything together, I realized this project wouldn't work (tips: make sure to check that the website you intend to scrape is properly marked up. 2 out of 3 of mine was not, making it impossible for me to get the data I needed.). After a big sigh and *two* espresso shots, I started over. I ended up creating a new project, this time a Stack Overflow Question's CLI App. In less than an hour, I was at the same place my DailyWord app had failed me. And this time my ideas worked. 

It has been four days of building, testing, and failing, *repeatedly*, to now finally have a project that works. But you know what? These have been the four most rewarding days of my Bootcamp experience so far. I have gotten to create something that I can truly say is my own. And I have learned so, so, so, much in the process of getting [here](https://github.com/hillevieklow/stack-overflow-questions-cli-app).
