Ultimately, the best thing about learning how to code is that one gets a functional set of skills that allows one to *create*. Today I finished my second personal project, and unlike my first one - a CLI application generating current StackOverflow Questions - this project is truly *personal* and feel extremely relevant to me and what I am doing in my life right now. Let me explain.

After spending two months full-time on Learn, I was now capable of creating CRUD-app that was relevant to me - a Running App. As a student-athlete about to head into my fourth and final soccer pre-season, staying fit is a must. I spent five days of putting together a small website that allowed for users to sign up and log in, recording all their running workouts (distance, time and descriptions), and stay up to date with what other users have been doing. I know that if I were to push this website online, it could provide an actual value for my team and I. Not to mention for my coach, who would be able to follow our cardio workouts and make sure everyone stays on track. And I created this! Yay! 

I am about halfway through the curriculum and I feel so good. Coding is awesome. Flatiron School is awesome. Life is awesome. I can create simple applications of value now. I can't wait to learn more.
