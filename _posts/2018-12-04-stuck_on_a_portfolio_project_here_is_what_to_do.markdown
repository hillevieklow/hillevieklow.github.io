My first three months at Flatiron School Online Web Developer Bootcamp was a blizz. I am not saying it was easy - it certainly was not - but I had a flow that really worked for me. I was on summer break, so for a typical day I simply woke up, took the Subway to the closest WeWork, grabbed a coffee, and worked through the curriculum. Repeat six days per week. But then, about 75% through the course, more specifically when it was time to do my Rails Portfolio Project, everything changed. 

What happened? Well, my summer break had come to an end. In fact, I was back to being a student-athlete, and more importantly, a college student. I could no longer have Flatiron School as my number one priority. All of a sudden, there were too many variables in my everyday life and I lost control over my discipline. I just assumed that since my first three months of Bootcamp went smoothly, it would continue to go smoothly. WRONG. As I put in less time per day, I lost track of what I knew (turns out it's much easier to remember something you read about yesterday, than to remember what you read last week.. duh). I started to struggle more. And more. And more. Three months later, and I was still at the same place as I was when summer break ended - trying to create a Rails Project - and I had eight abandoned rails projects in my GitHub repo to showcase my failure at progressing. 

I realized I needed to create a major change in my workflow, or I would be stuck at the Rails Project forever. So I did. This is what worked for me, feel free to take inspiration and apply it to yourself: 

**1. Create a mental restart day.** Remember how you flew past the curriculum at the beginning of the bootcamp? Exactly! Your discipline is incredibly high those first few days. Use this fact, and tell yourself that the INSERT-MENTAL-RESTART-DATE is the day you will begin again, and do everything in your power to get this project done.

**2. Plan out your project and EXACTLY how you will meet all requirement, BEFORE you start coding.** Oh, this one seems so obvious, yet overlooked way too often. At least I know I overlooked it. My first three rails projects were all incapable of meeting specific requirements and had to be thrown out. I would save myself so much time if I would have to take the time to plan BEFORE I started to code.

**3. Check with Flatiron School that your project theoretically WILL work.** No shame here. We are students - we are learning. To get a second opinion from an experienced eye will help you see things more clearly. (I believe project kick-off meetings with instructors are mandatory now! Yippie!)

**4. Do one thing at a time, and work in baby-steps** For instance, when creating models it can be tempting to immediately add validations, or class functions, although they do not serve any purpose yet. DO NOT. Take small steps, do one thing at a time. Essentially, avoid multitasking when writing code, and future you will thank you. 

**5. Plan out daily to-do's.**  I cannot stress this enough. Tell yourself that today you will implement a specific functionality. And you *will not stop* until you have. This leaves you feeling like you accomplished something every day, and gives off a significant daily self-confidence boost. 

**6. Keep your file tree clean, and committed** (assuming you are using an editor that's integrated with git and colors modified uncommitted files). This one became a gamechanger for me. To start of every mini-task with a fully committed file tree, allowed me to see exactly which files I had modified at my current to-do, and I saved lots of time looking up where I previously edited something. That goes without saying, take the time to commit --everything-- after you are done implementing a specific functionality, so you can start of your next to-do with a clean file tree.

**7. Do not be afraid to ask for help.** Flatiron School has fantastic instructors out there ready to help us, students, when we are lost. Sometimes it is worth it to save yourself a day of googling with booking a meeting with a pro instead. Secondly, the community on Slack is super helpful! Try to see if anyone else has run into the same problems. 

**8. Set a project deadline.** Pick a feasible project deadline and stick to it. Exactly like you cannot postpone Finals in school, or presentations at work, because "You don't feel ready", you cannot postpone this. You just can't. My personal project deadline is today, as I am writing this. Guess what? I worked super hard to get here and now my project is done. Now go do yours! :) 

Happy Bootcamping,
